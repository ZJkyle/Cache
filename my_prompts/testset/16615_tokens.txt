Mackinac Policy Conference: Michigan to Award $8M in Grants As Part of a ‘Mobility’ Initiative
Contents:
MACKINAC ISLAND (AP) — The state of Michigan will award $8 million in grants as part of a “mobility” initiative to spur new, practical and short-term ways to help transport seniors, people with disabilities and veterans with autonomous vehicles and other new technology.
The Michigan Mobility Challenge was announced Wednesday by Gov.
Rick Snyder and other top state officials at the Detroit Regional Chamber’s Mackinac Policy Conference. Snyder said one of the three pillars of advances in mobility is opportunity.
“This technology, the resources that will come to bear can give people opportunities do to things they otherwise may not be able to do in their lives because they have constraints, challenges they face,” he said during a news conference on the porch of the Grand Hotel. The goal with the challenge program, he said, is to “think out of box” and be proactive to spur pilot projects instead of waiting “for the rest of the world.”
The state will issue a request for proposals on June 4. An initial round of pilots will be operational by this fall.
State leaders hope that the auto industry, startup companies, local transit agencies, governments and advocates for the elderly, veterans and disabled will be involved in proposing public-private partnerships while seeking the funding. The grants will subsidize a portion of the costs to plan, implement and monitor services for three to six months. Remaining costs would be covered by fares and other funds.
“I’ll guarantee you not all of these are going to work great. But isn’t that the way we should be innovating? Let’s try things,” said Snyder, who said funding will not go to “science projects” requiring years of research but instead will be used to subsidize “near-term real things.”
Officials said the initiative is the latest move to ensure Michigan is a leader on self-driving vehicles and mobility technology. The state has taken a largely hands-off approach with regulations compared with some other states and is home to two major autonomous vehicle research facilities.

New Zealanders open up homes to Lions fans during tour
Contents:
New Zealand rugby fans have created an initiative to host British and Irish Lions supporters who are unable to find accommodation during their side's tour of New Zealand in June and July.
On the 10-match tour, the Lions play three tests against the All Blacks and five matches with New Zealand Super Rugby teams.
The tour is expected to attract more than 20,000 Lions fans.
A Facebook page called: "Adopt a Lions Fan 2017" was created by Adam Glishnan after he realized that many Lions supporters could not attend the tour due to lack of accommodation options. Over 100 participants have since posted on the page.
"I really hope friendships will develop out of this, because rugby is a great vehicle for it," Glishnan told the Guardian.
"We don't want money to change hands at all, we want visitors to experience the famed Kiwi hospitality, and give Kiwi rugby fans to opportunity to look after their Lions guests."
A majority of hotels in cities that are hosting the tests are 90 percent booked and services like AirBnb are offering rooms for prices as high as 670 pounds ($842.99) a night, according to the Guardian.

The Department of Justice (DOJ) honored on Friday the honest Bureau of Immigration (BI) officer who turned over to authorities a bundle of cash left at his counter at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) Terminal I.
DOJ Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II awarded a certificate of recognition to Immigration Officer (IO) I Reimond Abigeil Lagman for his uprightness after he immediately reported to his superiors his discovery of a white envelope, containing $1,900 (approx.
P95,000), on his counter at the airport last September 7.
The money was appropriately documented and handed over to the Airport Police Lost and Found section for safekeeping. The money is still unclaimed as of posting.

“Honesty and integrity in government service are core values that we want to inculcate in all our employees in the DOJ family,” Aguirre said.
“By his act of returning US$ 1,900.00, that was left at his counter at NAIA Terminal I, Immigration Officer I Reimond Abigeil B. Lagman has exemplified those valued traits.
The DOJ family lauds his truly commendable act,” he added.

There's a science behind the elegantly arranged bouquet of hydrangeas, or the bushel of roses with a trail of ivy a bride grasps as she walks down the aisle.
Like many beautiful things, it takes work.
About 150 gardening enthusiasts learned from one of the experts this week in an event hosted by the Naples Garden Club at Naples Botanical Garden. Michael Gaffney, director of the American School for Floral Design and world renowned floral designer, lead a workshop Monday on the patterns and formulas of floral design.
"It's a science more than anything," he said.

About 30 years ago Gaffney was working on Wall Street in New York City. While on vacation, he returned home to Milwaukee and found himself driving the truck for a local florist. He fell in love with the business, and made a major career change.
"I started seeing the patterns and formulas of all great design," he said. "And it’s very simple once you understand."
He spent six years learning the craft, and now Gaffney directs 14 floral design schools across the country. He's published two books, "Design Star" and "Flower Power," and has appeared on QVC, the Hallmark Channel and NBC's "TODAY" show.

On Monday, Gaffney demonstrated how to build 10 different floral arrangements influenced by traditional design and today's current trends. Using elements of math, science and architecture, Gaffney said anyone can do what he does for a living.
He started his talk on the subject of flower longevity. It's a common misconception, he said, that flowers last three to five days in a vase. But using his five-step process, Gaffney says they can last up to one month:
Buy good flowers Submerge the flower underwater for 30 to 45 minutes to hydrate the petals Add a couple drops of bleach to the water to stop the growth of bacteria Spray flower with wax sealant for lasting freshness; Gaffney uses Crowning Glory, which is available on Amazon.com Cut a couple inches off the stem every two to three days
Floral design is a science, Gaffney said, because the most appealing floral designs follow the laws of nature. For example, a large flower in the middle serves as a focal point in most arrangements, just as new growth surrounds old growth in nature.
Gaffney also applies basic math with ratios of flowers. His first arrangement was a heap of brilliant white hydrangeas, which he dusts with alum powder (found in the baking aisle at the grocery store) to help encourage water uptake and keep the flower from wilting. He built a bottom layer of seven flowers, then added four in a middle layer and one on the top to complete the ensemble.

Floral design also incorporates architecture, Gaffney said. He arranges in a pentagon shape, with a lower deck, middle deck and a "penthouse."
There are also more haphazard and unplanned arrangements — the wild and weedy "Napa Valley hot mess," as Gaffney called it, which is trending right now. Another was a European-style design, one that you might find in a Dutch painting. For those arrangements, he used crotons with splashes of red and deep orange, kale, dusty miller and even branches from a lime tree, fruit and all.
But even in the most wild arrangements, Gaffney applies his techniques of using leading lines to create movement.
"I follow patterns and rules," he said to the audience. "I'm a craftsman, that's what I do."

Other tips and tricks from Michael Gaffney:
Buy a rose that's already open.
If you remove thorns on a rose, it creates air holes and it will wilt faster.
When adding a flower to a bundle, use a close, wrap and twist movement. Point the stem like a sword into a magician's box, Gaffney said, and then twist it into formation.
Use the "zone and cluster" technique to achieve the wild and weedy look.
All things in nature have filler, he said. Add leafy greenery to plug holes between blooms in an arrangement.

Billy Graham’s last will and testament revealed
Contents:
When Billy Graham died at age 99 in his North Carolina home on February 21, he left behind a legacy of service to his Lord through preaching the gospel.
But according to his will, recently made public, that’s not all there is to his legacy.
Graham left some parting words and assets to his family – and some financial backing for his ministry, the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA).
Billy Graham
The 16-page document begins with a charge to his family members who remain.
“I ask my children and grandchildren to maintain and defend at all hazards and at any cost of personal sacrifice the blessed doctrine of complete atonement through the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ once offered, and through that alone,” he wrote.
“I urge all of you to walk with the Lord in a life of separation from the world and to keep eternal values in view.”
As a comfort to his family, he wrote: “When you read this I will be safely with Jesus in Paradise. I will be awaiting the reunion of our family in Heaven.”
Throughout the next section of the will, Graham chronicled the major points of his life – non-material blessings, such as his simple childhood on a Charlotte, N.C., dairy farm, marriage to Ruth Bell Graham and love for their five children.
“From the beginning of our marriage, we determined that we would be tithers,” wrote Graham of his and Ruth’s financial commitment to God’s kingdom. “We determined not to be preoccupied with material things, which leads to covetousness and which the Scriptures call idolatry.”
In keeping with his commitment on earth, Graham willed 10 percent of his residuary estate – that which is left after debts, funeral expenses, death taxes and all other claims are satisfied – to BGEA “to be used for the purposes of the Billy Graham Library Endowment.”
After the posthumous BGEA contribution, all remaining assets will be distributed equally among his five children: Virginia (“Gigi”) Graham, Anne Graham Lotz, Ruth (“Bunny”) Graham, Franklin Graham and Nelson (“Ned”) Graham.
Another beneficiary included in Graham’s will is his literary trust, which will hold the copyrights to his works.
But Graham left more than just parting words and material assets to his family and his ministry. He left behind one last charge – one last “invitation” – to anyone who has access to this public will.
“I urge all who shall read this document to read and study the Scriptures daily and to trust only in the Lord Jesus Christ for salvation,” he wrote.

Miami woman claiming to be engaged to Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs arrested for false allegations
Contents:
MIAMI BEACH, FLA.
(WSVN) - Miami Beach Police handle a variety of interesting cases each day, but one of their newest cases involving an internationally-acclaimed hip hop mogul might just take the cake.
According to Miami Beach Police, a Miami woman who claimed to be engaged to Sean “Diddy” Combs is accused of spending the past month going to great lengths to stalk her so-called “fiancé.”
But as fate would have it, her romantic efforts would ultimately end her up in the custody of Miami Beach Police on Valentine’s Day.
According to Miami Beach Police, 35-year-old Jermelah Jones made multiple calls to the Miami Beach Police, starting on the evening of Jan. 23, claiming that Combs was in distress. She told police that Combs was her fiancé and had called her stating he was being beaten and held against his will by his family members.
Once Miami Beach Police officers and fire rescue arrived to the residence of Combs, who had been fast asleep, their investigation ultimately concluded that her allegations were false since he was “clearly not in any distress.”
However, police said her calls did not end there.
Jones continued to make 911 calls for several days, and Miami Beach Police responded accordingly multiple times.
On Jan. 26, detectives met with Jones to tell her that Combs was fine but did not know who she was. They informed her that it was a criminal act to call police and make false reports about a crime. She told officers she understood and would not call any more.
However, she persisted.
On Feb. 6, Jones again called the Miami Beach Police Department to say that Combs was being held against his will. This time, she physically visited his residence and attempted to gain access to the property.
Police arrested Jones on Feb. 14. Once in custody, Jones told officers that she had been in a relationship with Combs for a few months but couldn’t recall any personal information about him. She then told police that she had been “recruited by the devil and his people.”
Jones was charged with one count of reporting a false crime to law enforcement officials.

Asamoah Gyan's hair deemed 'unethical' in UAE
Contents:
Black Stars Captain Asamoah Gyan is reported to be among 46 players deemed to have "unethical hair" under United Arab Emirates Football Association (UAEFA) guidelines.
The BBC reports that 31-year-old Gyan, on loan at Dubai-based Arabian Gulf League side Al Ahli from Shanghai SIPG, is one of 46 players whose clubs have been served warning letters to get their hairs in order.
In 2012, Saudi Arabia goalkeeper Waleed Abdullah was told to cut his "un-Islamic" hair by the referee before playing for his club side Al Shabab.
The Saudi rule bans mohawk-style cuts.
Some Islamic teachings ban 'Qaza' hairstyles, which include mohawks, because only part of the head is shaved, leaving other parts unshaven.
Individual match referees judge whether players' haircuts are appropriate, with some in United Arab Emirates concerned about children copying the styles.
The UAEFA send a player's club a warning letter in the first instance, with punishments escalating to a fine and then a suspension if he does not comply.
According to Middle Eastern football website Ahdaaf, Al Wahda's Suhail Al-Mansoori was told to cut his hair while UAE international and 2016 Asian footballer of the year Omar Abdulrahman, who sports a similar style and also plays in the Arabian Gulf League, was let off.

FALL BRANCH, TN (WJHL)- A video of a young boy from East Tennessee with tears in his eyes as he talks about bullying in school, has now been viewed tens of millions of times.
The video has sparked an outpouring of support, capturing the attention of celebrities and athletes nationwide.
Early this morning, we found that even THP state troopers had taken notice of this video.
THP Fall Branch District posted in a tweet Monday morning that ‘THPFallBranch is with you Keaton’
Sergeant Nathan Hall said the video tugged at the heartstrings of so many troopers across the state, including those right here in Northeast Tennessee.
“A couple of our troopers have reached out, wanting to go eat lunch with the young man, and I know he has overwhelming support right now within all of our districts in the state, especially the highway patrol.
Our communications director is discussing those possibilities and setting up things like that,” Hall said.
Hall said they are hopeful that THP troopers will be able to meet with Keaton, telling us some troopers said they could even put themselves in his shoes.
“I talked to another trooper that he was actually bullied as a child, and he still remembered the circumstances… we’ve talked to all the districts today and they all have a very overwhelming support of how that effected them by watching this video, and support to Mr. Keaton,” Hall said.
Hall also said they hope this leads to a bigger conversation and awareness about bullying in schools, advising parents and children if they want to know more about preventing bullying there is a website called stopbullying.gov.

Walgreens turns spotlight on pharmacists’ dedication
Contents:
DEERFIELD, Ill.
— Walgreens is honoring its more than 27,000 pharmacists for their dedication to patients and the expanding role they’re playing in overall health care for October’s American Pharmacists Month.
“Our pharmacists’ commitment to Walgreens patients is evident every day, and this year especially we’ve seen countless illustrations of our pharmacists going above and beyond,” Richard Ashworth, president of pharmacy and retail operations at Walgreens, said in a statement, pointing to efforts by Walgreens pharmacists to aid those impacted by the devastating 2017 hurricane season.
“As we recognize our pharmacists as part of American Pharmacists Month, it’s also an opportunity to highlight their extraordinary efforts after hurricanes impacted Texas, Louisiana, Florida and Puerto Rico,” Ashworth noted. “The care, teamwork and resilience demonstrated by Walgreens pharmacists and our other employees proved critical in meeting the needs of our patients and communities at a critical time.”
Walgreens said thousands of its employees and health service providers were involved in relief and recovery efforts in the wake of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria — a testament to the role Walgreens pharmacists play in their respective communities.
For example, Walgreens pharmacists helped meet medication and medical supply needs by deploying on-site pharmacy operations at several shelters, including one at the George R. Brown Conference Center in Houston and another at Florida International University (FIU) in Miami. The shelter at FIU housed Florida Keys evacuees with special medical needs as well as dialysis-dependent patients evacuated from the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.
Walgreens pharmacists also partnered with hospitals in areas affected by the hurricanes. The pharmacy manager of the Walgreens location at the Women’s Hospital of Texas in Houston, for instance, took it upon herself to compound medications for the hospital’s NICU patients. She also filled prescriptions so pediatric patients could be discharged from the hospital.
And at Baptist Hospital in Beaumont, Texas, when the Walgreens pharmacy staff weren’t able to get to the location because of flooding from Hurricane Harvey, several Walgreens pharmacists from nearby locations helped hospital staff get medications to patients in critical condition who were being transferred via helicopter.
During October and November, Walgreens also is recognizing its nearly 50,000 other health care service providers, including pharmacy technicians, Healthcare Clinic nurse practitioners and physician assistants for National Physician Assistant Week (Oct. 6 to 12), National Pharmacy Technician Day (Oct. 17) and National Nurse Practitioner Week (Nov. 12 to 18).

Wine & Swine
Contents:
The other night I attended my first “Wine & Swine” event for a lovely farm called Dingley Dell.
This was held at a charming Gastropub called the Leather Bottle in Earlsfield. As a North London lady I have not frequented the area however my aversions were quickly disbanded when I arrived in Earlsfield after a quick 20 minute transfer!
This pub is well worth a visit as it is my sort of place: homely, welcoming with a large beer garden. It was also hosting one of the first Wine & Swine events which is essentially a pork fest and pairing with Aspalls apple juice/cider and Meantime Beer. Apologies for any non meat eaters out there as this was a pure Pork feast by every sense of the word.
I was a guest of a journalist friend of mine. When we entered the huge beer garden there must have been long tables and seats for around 200 people. It reminded me of the recent Jubilee street parties – very British, local, and felt like I was back in my second home Dorset.
We were greeted by the largest suckling pig I have ever laid my eyes on. It was spinning quite happily and a whole hog filled with Aspalls apple juice. The hog was being cooked and marinated (using mustard, white wine, cider and some tuna extract) by one of the top chefs Mark Poynton patron of Alimentum in Cambridge.
We were then shown to our table which was the special “tree house” and here we were ruling the roost. We had access to the local farmer who actually was given a pig to chop up. It was more of a “masterclass” I could barely watch!
However the courses followed and these were 6 courses each paired with Aspalls Cider or Meantime Ale/Beer. The significance of this was to promote local produce and Meantime from Greenwich is no exception.
Each course was delicious and my companion and myself were in the treehouse with others.
The menu was as follows:
Starter – The Whole Hog Board – prepared by Chris Knights and Stephen Bushnell
Air dried pork leg, crispy pig’s ears, potted brawn, mini hot dogs, black putting trotter fritters, Gooseberry Chutney, purple basil jam and Young’s Beer Bread
Paired with Aspall’s Premier Cru
Apple Smoked Pig Cheeks – Paul Sowden
Potted smoked pig’s cheeks, mead jelly and pea puree
Paired with Meantime Wheat Beer
Low and Slow Pulled Pork Shoulder – Ben Goldsmith
Sweet and tender pork shoulder, slow cooked garlic, rosemary, black pepper, fennel and oregano (cooked over charcoal and hickory wood)
Paired with Aspall’s Premier Cru
Hog Spit – Mark Poynton
Whole hog filled with Aspalls Apple juice
Paired with Aspalls Premier Cru
World Championship St Louis Pork Ribs – Andy Annat
Lip smackin’ 5 hour cherry smoked pork ribs with barbeque and black treacle glaze served with smoked plant pot bread
Paired with Meantime London Pale Ale
Dessert – Sunday Brunch – Chris Knights and Stephen Bushnell
French toast with marmalade, maple cured bacon, Leather Bottle pears (from the garden) and cornflake ice cream
Paired with Aspalls Perronelle’s Blush
I have never felt so full on pork ever! However it was the tastiest and most divine pork meal I have ever had. Simply outstanding and not one to miss.
There are plans to host more as word is catching on and the PR company Roche Communications are busy dealing with the next event.
Do go and visit the Leather Bottle near Earlsfield Station and please do go to the next Wine and Swine event but remember not to eat for a day prior and you certainly won’t eat for the next day or two.
Happy dining and until next time!

For sale: one moat desirable des res, no chain mail.
An Englishman’s home is his castle.
And one estate agent is offering joust that – a castle, complete with its own moat.
With ramparts and portcullis, it’s ideal for keeping those unexpected visitors away.
Caverswall Castle, close to the Staffordshire Moorlands, is on sale for a cool £5 million.
That’s a lot of lolly, squire.
And hardly ideal for mere surfs like you and I.
Sutton Coldfield estate agents Paul Carr suggest the Grade I listed building, which comes with 20 acres of land, would make a perfect hotel.
(Image: Handout)
The publicity blurb states: “Stunning historic Grade I listed moated castle set in 20 acres in Staffordshire.
“An outstanding 18-bedroom country home, or with tremendous potential for commercial use as a fine hotel, wedding venue, wellbeing retreat etc.
“Planning permission granted for full C1 hotel use.”
Just be warned.
Viewing the property could take some time.
In truth, Caverswall is something of a faux castle. It was built in the 17th century, although it sits on the site of a 13th century castle.
The walls of that original fortress are still present – and the Doomsday Book records a manor house on the grounds.
The history is rich. During the English Civil War, the original castle was garrisoned by Parliamentary forces.
But it was showing signs of decay by the end of the 16th century.

The building was bought in 1615 by Stafford mayor and MP Matthew Craddock, who set about building the current mansion, which has three storeys, parapet and entrance porch.
Since then Caverdale’s CV has been varied.
In 1811, it was used as a nunnery by a Benedictine order. But be warned: this is not a sale to undertake on a mere wimple.
In the 1880s, it was rented by the Wedgwood family and in 1933 the Sisters of the Holy Ghost used the castle as a convent.
The Daughters of the House of Mary used it for the same purpose in 1965.

When they left in 1977, the castle was put on the market.
It was bought by property tycoon Robin MacDonald in 2006 for £1.7 million. Sotheby’s offered it for sale three years ago for £3 million.
Now, it could be yours. Just remember – there’s no rampart exchange.

Vitesse claim first major trophy with Cup triumph
Contents:
ROTTERDAM Vitesse Arnhem claimed the first major trophy in their 125-year history with a 2-0 victory over AZ Alkmaar in the Dutch Cup final on Sunday with a late double by Ricky van Wolfswinkel.
Striker Van Wolfswinkel headed home his first goal after 80 minutes and followed that up with a second two minutes from time to take his tally for the season to 21 in all competitions.
The 28-year-old former Netherlands international also collected the first trophy of a career that has seen him turn out for Sporting Lisbon, Norwich City and Real Betis.
Vitesse had finished runners-up in the Dutch Cup on three occasions, the last in 1990, and their triumph means they have qualified for the Europa League group stage next season.

2017 24 Hours of Le Mans: LM GTE Pro Preview
Contents:
As has become almost the standard in GT racing in the World Endurance Championship, Balance of Performance (BoP) is a big talking point in this class.
As the 24 Hours of Le Mans has its own rules for BoP and how it is calculated, some teams are affected more by BoP in this race than others. Ford Chip Ganassi feel they have been hit with BoP too hard for the 24-hour endurance race and believe it could be enough to take them out of contention for the win.
Current GT World Endurance Driver’s Championship leader Andy Priaulx stated that he did not feel Ford was the quickest on track in the Pro field for this race, something that has not been the case in the first two races of the season, because of the heavy BoP that Ford has been handed. He also commented that Ferrari, the fastest Pro cars in the test, were not even going as fast as the fastest Fords last year which seemed odd to him.
In terms of the Championship standings, it does make sense that Priaulx would be worried about a BoP deficit, especially to the AF Corse Ferraris that sit second and third in the championship. With double points on offer for this race event it could make all the difference to the championship winner at the end of the year.
The 2016 24 Hours of Le Mans saw Ford on top and looking unbeatable. Unfortunately for the WEC-running Team UK Ford GTs, it was the Team USA Fords that had all the luck and ended on the podium.
Five extra Pro cars join the field for this race, with all of the extra entrants coming over from American racing. Joey Hand and Dirk Müller return to try and take their second class win at Le Mans after winning last year. They come back in the #69 Ford Chip Ganassi Team USA car.
After his qualifying accident at the Indy500 that saw him suffer injuries to his hip and pelvis, Sebastien Bourdais has been forced to step out of the Ford due to his recovery. He will be unable to try and repeat his win from last year, but hands over the responsibility to fellow IndyCar competitor Tony Kanaan. Kanaan takes to the Circuit de la Sarthe for the first time ever in the practice session later on this evening.

German automakers face heat over tests on monkeys, humans
Contents:
FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Public criticism of the German auto industry has escalated after a report that an industry-sponsored entity commissioned a study of the effects of diesel exhaust using monkeys, while another study exposed humans to low levels of one type of air pollutant.
The German government on Monday condemned the experiments and Volkswagen sought to distance itself from them, with its chairman saying that "in the name of the whole board I emphatically disavow such practices."
The tests were reportedly commissioned by a research group funded by major German auto companies.
Revelations of the tests add a twist to the German auto industry's attempt to move past Volkswagen's scandal over cheating on diesel tests and the resulting questioning of diesel technology across the industry.
Volkswagen Chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch said the tests must be "investigated completely and without reservation," the dpa news agency reported.
A report by The New York Times found that the research group financed by top German car manufacturers commissioned experiments in which one group of monkeys was exposed to diesel exhaust from a late-model Volkswagen, while another group was exposed to fumes from an older Ford pickup.
The experiments were carried out in 2014 before Volkswagen was caught using software that let vehicles cheat on emissions tests.
They were intended to show modern diesel technology had solved the problem of excess emissions, but according to the Times report the Volkswagen car in the tests was equipped with illegal software that turned emissions controls on while the car was on test stands and off during regular driving.
Volkswagen admitted using the software in 2015. The Volkswagen scandal led to public scrutiny of diesel emissions as regulators discovered that other companies' vehicles also had higher emissions on the road than during testing, though not necessarily through illegal rigging. The industry has had to fend off calls for diesel bans in German cities with high pollution levels.
Daimler AG said it was "appalled by the nature and extent of the studies" and said that, though it didn't have any influence on the studies' design, "we have launched a comprehensive investigation into the matter."
BMW said that it "did not participate in the mentioned study" on animals "and distances itself from this study." It said it was investigating the work and background of the research group.
The Times report said the group that commissioned the studies, known by German initial EUGT, got all of its funding from the three automakers.
The Times report was followed by one in Monday's edition of the Stuttgarter Zeitung daily that the now-closed research group also commissioned tests in which humans were exposed to nitrogen dioxide, which belongs to a class of pollutants known as nitrogen oxides. The group reportedly said the tests showed no effect on the subjects.
The human study, carried out by Aachen University, involved studying the effects of exposing 25 subjects, mostly students, to low levels of nitrogen dioxide like those that could be found in the environment — from a 40-liter bottle, not a diesel engine. The individuals gave informed written consent for the study, which was approved by the ethics committee of the university's medical faculty, according to the study. The university said the study had no relation to the diesel scandal.
The German government condemned the reported tests on animals and humans. Transport Minister Christian Schmidt "has no understanding for such tests ... that do not serve science but merely PR aims," spokesman Ingo Strater told reporters in Berlin.
He called for the companies concerned to provide "immediate and detailed" responses, and said a ministry commission of inquiry that was set up after the emissions scandal broke will hold a special meeting to examine whether there are any other cases.
Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said that "the disgust many people are feeling is absolutely understandable."
"These tests on monkeys or even humans can in no way be ethically justified," Seibert said. "They raise many critical questions for those behind these tests, and these questions must urgently be answered."
He questioned the aims of the tests. "The automakers have to reduce emissions of harmful substances further and further," he said. "They should not be trying to prove the supposed harmlessness of exhaust with the help of monkeys or even humans."
Seibert said that the supervisory boards of the companies concerned "have a particular responsibility."
The governor of the German state of Lower Saxony, a major shareholder in Volkswagen, added his voice to calls for quick answers.
Stephan Weil, who sits on VW's supervisory board, stressed that "the behavior of the company must in every respect fulfill ethical demands." He said he hadn't known about the tests.
___
This story has been corrected to show that a research group commissioned the tests, not that it carried them out. A previous version corrected the first paragraph to show that the second set of tests on humans didn't involve diesel exhaust.

Public stands up to help radio station

Public stands up to help radio station
Alan Chartock (Photo via WAMC website)
“It’s all Trump,” said Alan Chartock, president and CEO of WAMC, the Albany-based public radio station that broke fundraising records on Feb.
6, during the first of three annual fund drives traditionally held by the station.
“This is a record-breaker,” Chartock said, noting that the nonprofit only began asking for a million dollars “a couple of years ago.” Typically, he said, it can take an average of seven to nine days for the station to hit that goal. While a little less than $500,00 was contributed prior to the fund drive kick-off and held in a “Locked Box,” Chartock said, “This is the first time we’ve done it on the first day we were actually on the air.”
WAMC began in the late 1950s as a radio station for Albany Medical Center and Albany Medical College (AMC), hence the call sign. In 1981, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) license on 90.3 FM was transferred to a 501c3 tax-exempt entity, WAMC, Inc., which had been set up by a group of five corporators — including Chartock, who joined the station in 1979 — affiliated with the State University of New York and New York State government. Currently, WAMC has 12 broadcast radio stations serving seven states in New England and Mid-Atlantic States and operates The Linda/WAMC Performing Arts Studio, a performance venue in Albany.
Chartock was there for the first ‘Save Our Station’ WAMC fund drive in 1979, the proceeds of which — about $129,000 —all went to AMC. This year, over a little more than 12 hours, the station raised an average of $50,000 an hour. “To me, that’s unbelievable,” he said.
Chartock can only remember twice in the history of the station when fund drives have even come close to ending so swiftly, and in neither case, he noted, had the financial ceiling been set so high. Both, however, do involve Gov. Mario Cuomo, the father of our current state governor who lost to Gov. George Pataki in 1994.
During his time in office, Cuomo had a regular show on AMC, called “Me and Mario.” After losing to Pataki, it was WAMC’s understanding that the governor would not be appearing on the subsequent fund drive initiative. “But he showed up,” said Chartock. “And we had a half an hour conversation and it was his valedictory ‘goodbye.’ There were people in tears.”
“And then,” he said, “the phone rang on one side of the room. And then a phone rang on the other. And then they rang for seven hours.”
The second instance happened after Pataki was in office. One of the governor’s top aides called Chartock to ask why Cuomo still made regular appearances on their station. “I said, ‘well, because he’s the greatest orator in the United States,” said Chartock, adding that he offered Pataki the opportunity to appear as often as he liked or even to have his own show. “He’s certainly not the most articulate guy in the world,” he said, “but I would have done it.”
Chartock walked in on the first day of the next fund drive and received word from a friend at the state Department of Education, who informed him that the state had figured out a formula by which to deprive the station of its funding. “So,” he said, “I get on the microphone and say, “Ladies and gentlemen, do you know what just happened? And I explained what happened and I said, ‘You know, when the nazis came, the first thing that happened was they took the radio station. When the communists came to town, the first thing they did was take the radio station.”
The phones, he said, “did not stop ringing.”
Even so, said Chartock, neither of those drives came close to netting $1 million.
Concerns over the federal administration’s threats to cut funding for The National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting as part of a wider program of federal budget cuts, said Chartock, are the most likely explanation for the enthusiastic giving. Supporters also helped to raise money for The First Amendment Fund, established in 2006 to protect the station in the event of a loss of federal funding. That fund, he said, has dwindled in recent years, but is now receiving renewed focus and funding.
WAMC donors have the opportunity to leave comments along with their donations. “I don’t remember all of them,” said Chartock. “There are thousands and thousands. But some said, ‘I’m scared.’ Some said, ‘ WAMC is one of the places where there is a true forum where anybody can say anything.’”
In addition to raising money for the of running the station — somewhere in the neighborhood of $7 million a year — WAMC partners with other organizations, such as The Adirondack Council, who match drive funds raised by the station and contribute those funds to a charitable cause.
This year, The Adirondack Council committed to keeping 200 tons of carbon pollution out of the atmosphere. Other February 2017 partners included: The Seymour Fox Memorial Foundation to provide 1,080 nights of emergency shelter; Joseph’s House & Shelter in Troy, which provides meals, access to personal care, medical and dental care, legal services and other support to keep the homeless off the streets; and The Fox Foundation, which, helped to provide 780 babies in the region with a month’s worth of diapers that will be distributed by The Food Pantries for the Capital District.
WAMC will hold two more fundraisers this year, but Chartock said that they’re happy to take donations at any time. To donate to the station or to its First Amendment Fund, visit www.wamc.org.

BAM! John Kerry Just Got ROCKED By British Prime Minister For His Attack On Israel!

BAM! John Kerry Just Got ROCKED By British Prime Minister For His Attack On Israel!
It’s not just Americans who are furious about Barack Obama’s and John Kerry’s utter betrayal of Israel.
It wasn’t enough that the Obama administration backed an anti-Israel United Nations resolution; Kerry had to give an anti-Semitic speech that made it worse. And that move has caused international outrage, with British Prime Minister Teresa May brutally criticizing Kerry for it.
A spokesperson for May slammed Kerry for ignoring other important issues, and only focusing on settlements in Israel, saying that he “missed the mark”. The United Kingdom did side with the United States in calling for an end to building settlements in Jerusalem, but they also did not ignore the other issues plaguing Israel and Palestine.
“We do not … believe that the way to negotiate peace is by focusing on only one issue,” the spokesperson said. “And we do not believe that it is appropriate to attack the composition of the democratically elected government of an ally.”
According to the New York Times, May was angry at how Kerry described the Israeli government, calling it the “most right-wing in Israeli history, with an agenda driven by the most extreme elements.” And for some reason, Kerry was actually surprised by May’s reaction.
“We are surprised by the U.K. Prime Minister’s office statement,” the State Department said. They argued that Kerry’s speech was “in line with the U.K.’s own longstanding policy and its vote at the United Nations.” Yet even left-leaning media outlets like the Washington Post criticized Kerry’s speech. Everything about this situation is a bomb for Obama and Kerry, and yet, the two of them are so clueless that they didn’t see it coming.
Thankfully, there are only a few more weeks of this idiocy left to endure.

Some Syrian Refugees Are Going Back to War Alongside Turkey
Contents:
Last week, in a cafe in Kilis, a small Turkish city a few miles from the Syrian border, Lt.
Col. Mohammed Hammadin was back for a few hours after leading an assault against Kurdish positions on a mountain south of the border. He is a former Syrian Army officer and a commander of the Levant Front, the largest faction of the Free Syrian Army.
Colonel Hammadin, 40, watched as a Free Syrian Army journalist shared video footage showing the colonel, still panting from his exertions, his hand on the shoulder of a captured Kurdish fighter.
He explained that his Syrian force shared aims with Turkey, first in wanting to see Mr. Assad go, but also in its dislike for the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or P.K.K., which has waged a separatist insurgency for three decades against Turkey.
Like most members of the Syrian opposition in Turkey, the colonel described all the various Kurdish militant groups, no matter which side of the border they were on, as part of the same P.K.K. organization.

“Turkey has a right to attack the P.K.K. for its own national security,” he said. “It has the right to clear the area because the P.K.K. can attack its cities from the border.”
While he and his forces want Mr. Assad gone, they also want a united Syria. The Kurds, whose population straddles Turkey, Syria and Iraq, have long wanted to carve out their own nation.
“The most important reason to fight them is that they are separatists,” he said. “They want their own cantons on the northern border.”

The Kurdish militias had frequently sided with the Syrian government against the Free Syrian Army in the war, he said, helping enforce the siege of Aleppo, displacing Arab communities from their villages, and oppressing their own Kurdish people.
“They committed many violations,” he said. “They were very pragmatic to gain their own ends — an independent state.”
Syrians forced to flee to Turkey are bitter at the Kurdish militants. As such, the Free Syrian Army has embraced the Turkish fight against the Kurdish militants with gusto.
Free Syrian Army soldiers posted video on social media showing themselves heading to the border to join the Turkish operation. Syrian volunteers have flocked to a recruitment center in the town of Urfa to sign up.
“People are volunteering,” Colonel Hammadin said. “It’s good they want to apply, but our numbers are enough.”
Hunched over a coffee table in another part of Kilis, two Syrian brothers, Murshid and Bashar Sheikh Naif, explained why their family supported Turkey’s latest operation.
Photo
They had joined the uprising against the Assad government from the start in 2011. Murshid, 32, a former policeman, was imprisoned by the government for 18 months. He was released when the Free Syrian Army exchanged captured government soldiers for him.
Of eight brothers in the Naif family, five have joined the Free Syrian Army over the years. They have fought multiple enemies — first Syrian government troops, then Russian and Iranian forces, then extremists of the Islamic State, and now American-backed Kurdish militias, whom they blame for forcing them from their home.

Two brothers were killed, one fighting against the government and one against the Islamic State. Bashar, 22, was wounded fighting the Islamic State in an earlier operation alongside the Turkish Army. Two more brothers have joined the latest operation against the Kurdish militias in the enclave of Afrin, they said.

“We were neighbors,” the elder Mr. Naif said of the Kurdish fighters. “There were no problems until the S.D.F. became an enemy and pushed us out of our villages.”
The family fled to Turkey as the Kurdish militia seized their hometown, Tal Rifaat, and surrounding villages in 2016, he said.
He played a video on his cellphone showing the exodus of refugees — some 200,000 Arabs were displaced from a string of 15 villages and towns north of Aleppo — and their shelters in mud-soaked camps.
Their father died soon after, distraught at the loss of their home, Mr. Naif said. Their mother was dying of cancer, his younger brother added.
“So we have a common cause,” Mr. Naif said. “There is a common interest in fighting against the P.K.K. with Turkey. Turkey is our personal ally and they helped the people a lot.”
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey gave the Free Syrian Army a strong endorsement in a speech on Tuesday, comparing them to Turkey’s National Forces, which fought for independence in the early 20th century.

“The Free Syrian Army is a civil formation, organized by people who gathered to protect their own country,” he said, addressing legislators from his Justice and Development Party. “We are happy to be side by side with our Syrian brothers in their freedom struggle.”
Nationalist support for the military campaign is running high in Turkey and dissent largely stifled. About 300 people, including members of the Turkish Medical Association, have been detained for expressing criticism of the operation on social media.

Some Syrian refugees in Turkey are confused as to what to think about Ankara’s decision to send tanks and planes into Syria.
Political and humanitarian activists voice fears that the operation will cause Syrians yet more civilian suffering, or stir strife between Kurdish and Arab communities in Syria.
Some warn that Syrian fighters are being used by foreign powers.
“Afrin is not our battle,” said an opposition activist, Yusuf Mousa. “As Syrians, we respect that Turkey is an ally of the Syrian revolution, but they are trying to make actions for their benefit.”
Yet while Turkey’s operation in Afrin has been cast as a narrow fight against Kurdish separatists, seizing the territory would boost the standing of the Free Syrian Army.
The group has steadily lost ground as an opposition force as the Syrian Democratic Forces, which the United States regards as its most effective partner in the fight against the Islamic State, have gained prominence.
With Turkey’s help, the Free Syrian Army wants to seize the northern countryside around Tal Rifaat and open a corridor to the northwestern province of Idlib, to rescue more than a million trapped civilians and fighters.
Mr. Erdogan has vowed to take control of a 20-mile zone along the length of Turkey’s border with Syria, and has called on United States forces to pull back from the Syrian town of Manbij.
Colonel Hammadin did not say how far his soldiers would go, but he ruled out any confrontation with American troops. He said he hoped for the United States’ support against Mr. Assad.
“America has the ability to do anything,” he said. “We look forward to them making the Assad regime leave.”

RTA and ATU union contracts expire December 31st, strike looms
Contents:
DAYTON, Ohio (WDTN) – The contract between the Dayton Regional Transit Authority (RTA) and Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU) expires at the end of the month, which means a potential strike could happen if an agreement isn’t made.
The ATU president Glenn Salyer says the main concern surrounds healthcare.
In January the ATU went on strike for four days leaving thousands in the region without transportation over the same issue.
“We have a hundred new employees and at best their being paid $14.40 an hour and they’re being asked on a family plan that they could possibly see $11,000 a year in expenses,” said Salyer.
The RTA’s CEO Mark Donaghy released the following statement regarding the matter:
I am disappointed that instead of negotiating with RTA or through the state appointed mediator that Local 1385 leadership has resorted to using the media and threatening the public with another strike to further his interests. RTA has offered the union a proposal that allows their members to reduce their premium share for health insurance by one-third. The union’s current proposal would increase costs to RTA by $1.4 million per year. Given our financial situation, having to address a $3 million deficit for 2018 which will cause us to consider raising fares and to reduce service, the union proposal is just not acceptable as it would require further cuts in service to accommodate. We have offered to meet with the union and the mediator and hope to do so soon.”
Salyer says the ATU does not want to go on strike and that the union would accept the same deal they agreed upon last time.

Wily bald underground critter uses plant-like survival strategy

WASHINGTON They are homely, buck-toothed, pink, nearly hairless and just plain weird, but one of the many odd traits of rodents called naked mole-rats that live in subterranean bliss in the deserts of East Africa could someday be of great benefit to people.
Scientists said on Thursday the rodents, when deprived of oxygen in their crowded underground burrows, survive by switching to a unique type of metabolism based on the sugar fructose rather than the usual glucose, the only animal known to do so.
Metabolizing fructose is a plant strategy, and the researchers were surprised to see it in a mammal. They now hope to harness lessons learned from this rodent to design future therapies for people to prevent calamitous damage during heart attacks or strokes when oxygenated blood cannot reach the brain.
Naked mole-rats, they found, can survive up to 18 minutes with no oxygen and at least five hours in low-oxygen conditions that would kill a person in minutes.
More closely related to porcupines than moles or rats, they thrive in colonies boasting up to 300 members including a breeding queen in an insect-like social structure of cooperation in food-gathering and tunnel-digging. With all those rodents breathing and clogging up burrows, they often encounter low-oxygen and high-carbon dioxide conditions.
"Naked mole-rats have evolved in an extremely different environment from most other mammals and they have had millions of years to figure out how to survive dramatic oxygen deprivation," said neurobiologist Thomas Park of the University of Illinois at Chicago, who helped lead the study published in the journal Science.
In low-oxygen conditions, they enter a coma-like state and release fructose into the blood. By shifting their metabolism from the normal glucose-based system that relies on oxygen to a fructose-based system that does not, they can fuel vital organs such as the heart and brain.
Naked mole-rats live up to 30 years, decades longer than other rodents, are nearly immune to cancer and do not feel many types of pain. As the only cold-blooded mammal, they huddle together in mole-rat piles in order to keep warm. Their lips close behind their teeth so that they can dig with their teeth without getting dirt in their mouths. Their ears and eyes are tiny, and they have poor eyesight.
"Fructose has been linked to obesity and metabolic syndrome but that's because we over-consume it in sweet beverages and junk food. Perhaps there is a use, and an important one, for fructose in moderate doses after all," added molecular biologist Jane Reznick of the Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association in Berlin.

In brief: Musk has officially announced his intentions to compete for a contract to build a high-speed loop in Chicago, through his venture The Boring Company.
Not a hyperloop, this railway system will instead use electric pods.
A BORING LOOP
Surprise, surprise — Elon Musk has announced another major new project via Twitter. This time, Musk has revealed a project within his drilling venture, The Boring Company. The company, according to Musk, will “compete to fund, build & operate a high-speed Loop connecting Chicago O’Hare Airport to downtown.”

The goal of the new system, according to the Chicago Sun-Times, is to shuttle Chicago residents between downtown and O’Hare airport in less than 20 minutes — half the time of the current commute. Musk and his competitors for the Chicago contract will have to include both a downtown and airport station, as well as a maintenance facility, and have a plan in place to minimize “potential conflicts or impacts on existing transportation systems and the environment.”
A part of the “O’Hare express project,” this concept has been a dream and goal of Chicago’s elected officials for many years. In fact, Chicago’s former Mayor, Richard M. Daley, tried to convince Chinese investors to build the railway system stemming from the Block 37 super-station. But until now, this concept has remained an ambitious, lofty hope — right up Elon Musk’s alley.
A NON-HYPER LOOP
The Sun-Times notes that top mayoral aides took a trip to Los Angeles earlier this year, to discuss the hyperloop option with Musk. Current Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanual has expressed enthusiasm over hyperloop technology, and previously said that Musk was “very interested.”
However, Musk has clarified that the Chicago system would not actually be a hyperloop. He explained the distinction on Twitter, saying that “A Loop is like a Hyperloop, but without drawing a vacuum inside the tube. Don’t need to get rid of air friction for short routes.”
Can you clarify what's a "high-speed loop"? I assume we are not talking hyperloop? Is it the previously unveiled electric skate concept? — Fred Lambert (@FredericLambert) November 30, 2017
Instead of the vacuum-pods that are part of Hyperloop’s signature, this venture will instead use electric pods to transport people.
There are very few details about the current status of this venture, but we hope to soon learn more about the future of high-speed, public transport in Chicago.

Title:
For many young Canadians, home won't be a house
Contents:
It’s probably time for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to tell his young followers that the “Canadian dream” no longer comes with a lawn.
Last week, Statistics Canada reported a big drop in the issuance of building permits for single-family homes in cities with populations greater than 10,000.
Municipalities in June granted permissions for such structures at a seasonally adjusted rate that would yield 65,100 units in a year, the slowest pace since April 2009 and one of the weakest on records that date to 1960.
The decline is noteworthy because you’d think the stars were aligned for a boom in the construction of dream homes: the economy has been churning out jobs steadily for a year, real-estate prices are high, and interest rates are low. There should be lots of incentive for everyone involved to build, borrow, and buy. Yet that’s not what’s happening. Those high prices have become too much for normal people, especially in Vancouver and Toronto. Tighter lending standards are also forcing dreamers out of the market. And perhaps more importantly, city officials remain stingy with land and permits in the places where most people want to live. “Toronto is a gateway for new immigrants,” Quentin D’Souza, who runs a couple dozen rental buildings in the Greater Toronto Area, told me earlier this summer. “We don’t produce enough new housing for all of those people.”
Since housing is mostly a local matter, you might be wondering why we need to drag the Prime Minister into this.
The answer depends on whether you think the federal government can play a catalytic role in forcing local authorities to confront national issues. Most (not all) agree that income inequality is one such issue. Trudeau certainly does. There is little that he or his cabinet ministers do that isn’t justified by supporting the “middle class and those seeking to join it.” More generous childcare benefits, middle-income tax cuts, multi-billion-dollar infrastructure programs, and new free-trade deals all are necessary to keep Canada from becoming an unequal society, the federal government suggests.
All that is fine. Yet the main thing that is turning Canada into a more rigidly class-based society is the real-estate boom. For whatever reason, most Canadians see a mortgage as preferable to paying rent and maxing out their RRSP deductions and TFSA limits. But in most cities, a decent house is now something only rich people can afford. Vancouver is the world’s third-most unaffordable city, after Hong Kong and Sydney, respectively; and Toronto is now the 13th most unaffordable, behind a group of usual suspects such as Auckland (fourth), San Francisco (ninth), and London (12th), according to the latest Demographia International Housing Affordability Survey. This is not the company that a country that believes in spreading the wealth ought to be keeping. If you don’t think the housing boom is causing angst, then you missed the excellent reporting of Joe Castaldo and Catherine McIntyre in Maclean’s earlier this year. As one half of a young couple that had been priced out of Vancouver told them, “You definitely feel like you’ve been left behind.”
Demographia, a St. Louis-based consultancy that opposes top-down urban planning, keeps its analysis of international housing affordability elegantly simple. It creates a “median multiple” by dividing the median house price in a given market by the median household income. Historically, Demographia says a multiple of three or less suggests normal people can afford a home. That’s the base of its affordability scale. The maximum is five or higher, which is the point at which the survey describes housing as “severely unaffordable.”
Vancouver’s multiple is 11.8 and Toronto’s is 7.7; both scores are a point higher than 2015, suggesting median homes prices in each city increased by the equivalent of a full year’s income in the span of 12 months. In fact, none of Canada’s major cities is affordable: Montreal, Calgary, and Edmonton all are “seriously unaffordable,” with multiples higher than four. Demographia says Ottawa is “moderately unaffordable,” with a multiple of 3.9. This represents a “sea change,” according to the report; until recently, affordability outside of Vancouver had been fairly stable since the 1970s. “The health of the housing market has been deteriorating rapidly in Canada,” the report states.
Trudeau and his ministers know the urban middle- and upper-middle-class Canadians that form the core of their political constituency are sensitive about housing. At a semi-private speech in Montreal this spring, Finance Minister Bill Morneau said that as a member of Parliament and a Cabinet minister, he felt Canadians were “counting on you to ensure their home keeps its value.” Recall “David,” the everyman who appeared on the first page of Morneau’s first budget in 2016: “Though he loved the community he lived in as a child, when it came time to buy his own family home, [David] had to look elsewhere. His old neighbourhood simply wasn’t affordable.” Among the highlights of this year’s budget was a promise to spend $11.2 billion on affordable housing.
Still, it’s fair to ask whether Trudeau has any desire to bring real-estate prices back down to Earth.
Doing so would please the men and women Castaldo and McIntyre wrote about, and surely would be welcomed by those “seeking” the trappings of the middle class. At the same time, any attempt to depress prices would anger anyone who already owns a home, a massive voting block, considering ownership rates now approach 70 per cent. That could be why Morneau talks of “protecting” home values, rather than making housing more affordable. The federal government’s housing strategy will help some people, but it will do nothing to alter price dynamics, especially as the money will be spent over a decade. Morneau initiated regulatory changes that make it more difficult to get home loans, but he so far has stayed away from sacred housing sops, such as the capital-gains exemption on primary residences and the ability of first-time buyers to use their tax-protected savings to purchase homes.
Demographia says Singapore and New Zealand are the only two countries that appear to be taking the issue of housing affordability seriously. (The organization’s analysis is based on assessments of those two countries, along with Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Ireland, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the U.S.) New Zealand is the more instructive example; its politicians appear to have accepted that home prices are off the charts for lack of supply. Space is dear on a tiny island, but New Zealand authorities have constrained it even more by constraining development. Canada is as guilty of this as any jurisdiction, whether it be restrictive zoning requirements in Vancouver or Ontario’s safeguarding of green space in and around the Greater Toronto Area. The response of governments in Ottawa, Victoria, Vancouver and Toronto to the threat of a housing bubble has been almost entirely focused on gently squeezing demand rather than encouraging more supply.
By no means do I mean to give Demographia the final word on the subject. The outfit submits that sprawling Dallas-Fort Worth is a more livable city than Toronto because Dallas’s inhabitants tend to have shorter commutes to work. That car-loving conclusion gives away Demographia’s ideological bias. No doubt, an interesting argument could be had about whether a future of self-driving, electrically propelled automobiles could be as clean and efficient as better public transit. But only the purest free-market disciples would condemn attempts to make cities denser.
Canada’s bigger municipalities are headed this way. In recent years, they have been encouraging developers to build up, rather than to spread out. Cities issued permits for multi-family dwellings at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 169,600 in June, the fastest since October 2016. If we assume those permits turn into holes in the ground, Canada is putting up apartment complexes at the fastest rate since the early 1970s.
That’s probably a good thing. It will increase the odds that urban Canadians will at least be able to find a suitable place to live. But will it make people happier? Ideology aside, Demographia has a point when it argues that Dallas beats Toronto also because more people in the Texas city can afford to buy a home. Canadians might prefer urban planning that put “people” ahead of “place.” Take another look at the historical pattern for building permits in that chart above. There was a time when Canada built more single-family homes than multi-family units. The relationship has reversed, and the gap between apartment living and the prospect of backyard barbecues has never been wider in Canada’s cities.
Does any of this really matter? Robert Shiller, a Nobel laureate in economics, thinks it does. The Yale University professor says societies could rue allowing people to be priced out of their communities. “With people of various income levels increasingly divided by geography, income inequality can worsen and the risk of social polarization—and even serious conflict—can grow,” Shiller said recently in an op-ed for Project Syndicate. Inequality of income begets inequality of opportunity, which begets societal tension and political volatility. See: Donald Trump’s America.
A generation of Canadians that took space for granted is now discovering that their future will be measured in 900 square feet or less. That needn’t be a big deal, except as Castaldo and McIntyre showed earlier this year, it is a big deal for a lot of people. Will those people adapt and make the most of their lawn-less futures? Or will they grow to resent the lucky ones who owned homes at the beginning of the boom and the politicians who failed to keep prices under control?
At the moment, it appears Trudeau, Morneau and their counterparts in the provinces and on municipal councils are most concerned with helping the lucky ones. That’s good news for the existing middle class. But if you are seeking to join it, you have reason to be disappointed.

Garnier tells Halifax murder trial off-duty cop asked him to choke her
Contents:
Pink asked Garnier to step down from the witness stand and describe what happened next, using a table to imitate the mattress on the pullout.
He stood directly in front of the jury and walked backwards toward a rectangular table behind him, saying that he was leading Campbell to the bed and that she was walking backwards toward it.
He lay down on the table, saying Campbell's head was at the foot end of the mattress.
He leaned on his right side to describe how he was situated next to Campbell on her left side.
He said she asked him to slap her.
"I did it three times, fast," said Garnier, adding that he wasn't looking at her because, "I was uncomfortable and embarrassed about what I was doing."
He said his forearm was across her neck, and that he felt his arm getting wet, and saw blood.
Garnier said he went to get a towel and when he returned, she wasn't moving. He said he shook her shoulders and saw her open her eyes and gasp.
"I could hear air come out of her lungs," Garnier said.
Garnier said he then vomited.
He said the image of Campbell lying motionless on the pullout couch was imprinted in his mind.
He said at the time, he stepped back and repeated to himself, "She's dead."
He has pleaded not guilty to the second-degree murder of the Truro, N.S., police constable and interfering with a dead body.
Garnier told the jury he doesn't remember putting Campbell in a wheeled compost bin, to dispose of her body near Halifax's Macdonald Bridge.
He said when police first showed him surveillance footage from that morning of a man rolling a compost bin away from the McCully Street flat, "It was like watching somebody else in my body."
Garnier said the next thing he recalls is looking up and seeing the pillars of the ramp leading up to the bridge, and then his friend Mitch Devoe waking him up the next day back at the apartment.
He said he does not recall walking through the city's north end with a compost bin, or what happened to the mattress from the pullout couch. The jury has heard that the mattress has never been found.
He said he drove through the north end and by the bridge numerous times, trying to piece together what happened. He was arrested in the early hours of Sept. 16, 2015, after driving by the area where her body was found off Valour Way.
During cross-examination, Crown attorney Christine Driscoll noted that Garnier told police during an interrogation that he hit Campbell with his fist and choked her.
Garnier said he didn't tell them about Campbell asking him to choke her because "They would think I was just trying to blame it on her."
"Well you're blaming her today, aren't you," Driscoll said.
Garnier said he was telling the officers what they wanted to hear, and believed them when they repeatedly told him things like it was an accident and mistake.
"At that point it was the only thing getting me out of that room," Garnier said.
He also conceded that he did not perform CPR on Campbell, despite his training as a firefighter, and that he did not call 911.
Garnier also read aloud the letter he wrote to Campbell's family during the interrogation, crying as he said he was sorry for what happened and that he meant everything he wrote.
"If I could talk to her family I would say that I am sorry," he said through tears, briefly glancing in the direction of Campbell's family sitting in the courtroom gallery.
