K Club ex-manager claims he was threatened over call girl allegation
Contents:
A former manager at the exclusive K Club claims he was threatened by another man at Punchestown Races that club owner Dr Michael Smurfit had “not forgotten” statements he had made previously about the businessman and call girls.
In High Court proceedings, Peter Curran claims the statement during the encounter with Gerry Byrne, a K Club employee, was a reference to another case he had previously settled relating to his own employment at the K Club, in which he had referred in a document to call girls being given free use of the hotel facilities at the five-star resort.
Mr Curran told the court that, in May 2011, he was at the dryer in the men’s toilets at the racetrack when Mr Byrne, a resort superintendent at the K Club, blocked his way.
“He said: ‘I have a message from Dr Smurfit.’ He said Dr Smurfit had not forgotten the statement I made about him and call girls and that he knows where to find you and this is not over.”
Mr Byrne said Dr Smurfit did not care about any agreement, Mr Curran said.
Mr Curran, of Cahirciveen, Co Kerry, has sued Gerry Byrne along with the K Club Ltd, Straffan, Co Kildare, and Dr Smurfit, who has an address in Monaco.
The defendants deny his claims.
The court heard Mr Curran had, in 2008, settled proceedings relating to his employment and his departure from the K Club 10 years previously.
The reference to call girls arose from “replies to particulars” – part of the documentary preparation process in legal actions – relating to the “A case”, the one settled in 2008.
Opening Mr Curran’s case on Wednesday, his counsel Kenneth Fogarty said the allegation was “hanging in the air”.
Counsel said Mr Curran was a sensitive, vulnerable person who had previously suffered from depression and post-traumatic stress over the circumstances in which he left his employment at the K Club in 1998.
Counsel said: “They didn’t care about Peter Curran but they do care about call girls.”
Part of the evidence would be that Michael Smurfit was “aware that it was taking place and [that] he was not unaccustomed to the company of call girls on occasions”, counsel said.
Mr Fogarty said the case related to what was going on in the K Club.
It could close its eyes to an activity which was “criminal in nature and abusive to women”.
Unfair dismissal case
Mr Curran was catering manager at the K Club between September 1997 and October 1998 when he claims he was forced to leave. He later brought an unfair dismissal case which was settled in March 1999.
He also brought High Court proceedings claiming alleged breach to his constitutional right to his good name and to earn a livelihood.
During the run-up to that case, in replies to written questions and particulars relating to alleged financial irregularities that he allegedly uncovered at the K Club, Mr Curran made reference to call girls who allegedly were sometimes sourced abroad and allegedly were given free use of the hotel facilities at the K Club.
It is also claimed that he said in those answers to particulars that the owners of apartments unknowingly received rental income from the K Club as a result of call girls using the apartments.
Those proceedings were settled and it is claimed that it was an implied term of the agreement that Mr Curran would not be threatened, harassed or intimidated in any manner.
Mr Curran claims that, on May 7th, 2011, his way was blocked in the toilets at Punchestown Races and Mr Byrne allegedly made the “this is not over” comments.
All defendants deny the claims. Dr Smurfit and the K Club deny the incident took place but say, if it did, Mr Byrne did not act on their behalf or on their instructions.
Following an application on behalf of counsel for Dr Smurfit, which was adopted by the other defendants, Mr Justice Anthony Barr ruled he did not intend to allow the trial to “go completely off the rails” and engage in investigation of allegations made by Mr Curran against his former employers.
Earlier Mr Fogarty said Mr Curran felt he was being “blackballed” by the K Club after he left.
He set up a situation with a solicitor where, in the name of another man, he asked for a reference from the K Club for Mr Curran. Counsel said it came back that Mr Curran was not to be trusted.
The case continues.

Waste plant doesn't fit vision of Slate Belt group | Letter
Contents:
The recent information on the plans of the group known as Slate Belt Rising sounds interesting and certainly worthy of community support.
However, the approval of a proposed Synagro human waste treatment plant in our area does not conform with the vision of the Slate Belt Rising group of volunteers, which seeks to "rebrand" the Slate Belt and give a boost to the appearance of properties.
Sadly, we have a waste-filled landfill rising higher and higher each year in Plainfield Township that impacts on our neighborhoods. Remember, facade upgrades and public relations efforts will not help us in the future if our environment is contaminated by waste and odors from the landfill and trucks carrying human waste from three states to a facility that creates foul-smelling fertilizer.
We need to remain vigilant and make sure that the very people who are funding the paint aren't trying to buy favor from us for the money they will earn by bringing everyone's trash and human waste through our neighborhoods.

US protesters march to condemn widespread racism
Contents:
Thousands of Americans held demonstrations on Sunday in New York City and Washington, DC to protest President Donald Trump’s response to the deadly violence that erupted at the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville over the weekend.
According to presstv.ir, the demonstrators marched from Columbus Circle to Times Square in New York City.
They held signs with messages reading, “No! The Trump/Pence Regime Must Go!” and “Make Racists Afraid Again…Smash White Supremacy!”
The protesters tried to hold a demonstration outside Trump Tower in Manhattan in New York City, but police prevented them from gathering in front of the building.
Meanwhile, thousands of people also held a rally outside the White House before marching toward the Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC. The demonstrators yelled "shame, shame" as they gathered outside the hotel owned by the billionaire president.
In Seattle, police made arrests and confiscated weapons as Trump supporters and counter-protesters converged in downtown.
Elsewhere, demonstrators denounced fascism and called for the removal of Confederate monuments, which initially prompted the violent rally by white nationalists in Charlottesville.
The Charlottesville chaos, which caused three deaths, was held to protest the removal of a Confederate statue.
President Trump came under bipartisan criticism after he failed to explicitly condemn the white nationalists for Saturday’s outbreak of violence in Charlottesville.
The White House later tried to placate critics, saying Trump’s vague condemnation of “many sides” included Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazi and all extremist groups.
It said the president denounced all forms of violence, bigotry and hatred.
"The president said very strongly in his statement yesterday that he condemns all forms of violence, bigotry, and hatred," the White House clarified on Sunday. "He called for national unity and bringing all Americans together."
Trump said on Saturday during an event in Bedminster, New Jersey, that he was not responsible for the crime as similar attacks had already taken place under his predecessors.
"It's been going on for a long time in our country. Not Donald Trump. Not [former President] Barack Obama. This has been going on for a long, long time," he said, before highlighting his accomplishments.
But Republicans and Democrats have called for a straightforward condemnation from Trump, urging him to denounce the car incident as a terror attack by white supremacists.

Terrorists begin evacuating from Lebanon’s Arsal to Syria
Contents:
Hundreds of anti-Syria terrorists started evacuating from an enclave in Lebanon on the border with Syria after the defeat of Takfiri terrorists during a Hezbollah offensive.
Buses carrying 300 Saraya Ahl al-Sham terrorists and 3,000 Syrian refugees left eastern Arsal on Monday at 10:00 a.m.
local time, the Lebanon-based Arabic-language Al-Manar television network reported.
The departure comes as part of an agreement that followed a July's offensive by the Lebanese resistance movement and the Syrian Army to drive out terrorists from their last stronghold in the border area between Lebanon and Syria, Press TV wrote.
Earlier this month, the Lebanese resistance movement said its fighters had regained control over all areas in Arsal, which lies about 124 kilometers northeast of Beirut.
Al-Nusra Front terrorists, now known as Fateh al-Sham, withdrew following a series of consecutive defeats that forced them to agree to a cease-fire.
Under the deal, the Syrian government will shuttle the terrorists and their families to Idlib Province and some other areas.
The Lebanese security official overseeing the arrangements, General Abbas Ibrahim, said on Friday that a group of the refugees would go to the government-held area of Assal al-Ward along the Syrian-Lebanese border.
He said the terrorists and their families will be headed to another part of Syria, without elaborating.
However, a military media unit run by the resistance movement said last week that they would go to the Al-Ruhaiba town in the Eastern Qalamoun region, which is held by the Takfiri terrorists.
Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah stressed on Sunday that the areas liberated from the control of the terrorists would be handed over to the Lebanese Army.

MIDEAST STOCKS-Dubai, Egypt outperform, Abu Dhabi's TAQA surges again on land transfer, higher capex
Contents:
* TAQA up again in high vole on land, higher capex
* Dubai firms and in slightly higher volumes
* Egypt follows global shares up
* Kuwait, Saudi, Qatar underperform
By Celine Aswad
DUBAI, April 3 Stock markets in the Middle East diverged on Monday with Dubai and Egypt's index outperforming their peers while shares of Abu Dhabi National Energy soared again on investors' optimism that the company had turned a corner.
Shares of Abu Dhabi National Energy jumped 9.6 percent in a second day of unusually heavy trade.
On Sunday its shares had surged their 15 percent daily limit.
TAQA said it had secured land from its top shareholder valued at 18.7 billion dirhams ($5.1 billion), and had increased its capital expenditure in 2017. The increase will be self-funded by cash generated by the business said the company's spokesman.
"This is the biggest clean up the company is seeing and going forward those assets – the land – will bring revenues and be converted into profits," said Mohammed Yasin, head of NBAD Securities.
"The restructuring that has happened has given investors comfort that the government is supporting the company due to its losses in oil and gas," Yasin added.
Last week TAQA reported a 2016 loss of 18.55 billion dirhams, largely fuelled by 16.9 billion dirhams post-tax impairment related to its oil and gas assets.
The index rose 0.4 percent and volumes stayed at the low levels they have been trading in over the last several weeks.
Dubai's index climbed 1.4 percent in the highest daily volumes in three weeks. The benchmark had been trading in a narrow range for most of March, and volumes had been dwindling for the last 10 sessions as most institutional investors lacked reasons to allocate funds.
On Monday, 25 shares rose while only five declined; Union Properties climbed 2.5 percent and the most traded share for a second day in a row. Other small and mid sized shares also outperformed.
Egypt's index rebounded 1.2 percent, following global shares higher. Two-thirds of shares listed on that index rose and foreign institutional investors were net buyers, exchange data showed.
Juhayna Food Industries added 1.5 percent. On Sunday a local daily paper said, citing company spokesman, the dairy maker had started operations in its new farm in the west of Egypt. The area is 10,000 feddans (10,380 acres), with investments reaching 600 million Egyptian pounds ($33.1 million).
Alongside its current products, the new facility will also be making a new milk product. The output capacity and financial impact were not stated.
UNDERPERFORMERS
Kuwait's index, which has been one the best performing stock markets in the world since the start of the year, fell 0.3 percent to 6,999 points but closed 65 points above its intra-day low.
Kuwait Food Co lost 2.3 percent but hospital manager Al Mowasat Healthcare, which had slumped as much as 6.8 percent earlier in the day as its shares went ex-dividend, rebounded 4.1 percent.
Saudi Arabia's index fell 0.3 percent in slightly lower liquidity than the previous session. Number of declining shares outnumbered advancing ones 101 to 44.
Domestic-focused shares were some of the main underperformers, with apparel retailer and mall operator Fawaz Alhokair, the worst performer on Monday, dropping 3.0 percent.
Qatar's index closed down 0.5 percent as a little over half of the 20 blue chip shares declining. Islamic lender Masraf Al Rayan was the main laggard, dropping 3.0 percent.
MONDAY'S HIGHLIGHTS
SAUDI ARABIA
* The index edged down 0.3 percent to 6,968 points.
DUBAI
* The index added 1.4 percent to 3,539 points.
ABU DHABI
* The index edged up 0.4 percent to 4,467 points.
QATAR
* The index fell 0.5 percent to 10,344 points.
KUWAIT
* The index fell 0.3 percent to 6,999 points.
EGYPT
* The index rebounded 1.2 percent to 13,061 points.
OMAN
* The index climbed 1.1 percent to 5,597 points.
BAHRAIN
* The index edged up 0.1 percent to 1,348 points. ($1 = 3.6728 UAE dirham) ($1 = 18.1500 Egyptian pounds)
