Eco-Friendly Packaging Lining to Encourage Asia’s Packaging Market: Ken Research
Contents:
Safety is a major concern in any industry since the beginning.
Whether it is for food processing or packaging, manufacturers are being sure that all edible products are kept fresh and good until they are consumed. It is the responsibility of the manufacturers of the product to provide safe packings with lining to avoid spillage or contamination. It is important to remember that any item may be subjected to environmental stimulus, edible or not, that enters the confines of a food while producing, processing, transporting or storage facility, has the probability to cause harm, to human beings, pets, products and businesses if not treated, validated for suitability, wholesomeness from a regulatory and industry standards standpoint.
Many manufacturers manufacture polycoated and wax papers for the packaging of food products either ready to eat or package foods or other dry or wet raw foods. These packaging papers are grease proof treated in the form of bags and pouches that hold processed, semi-processed or raw foods. Asian consumers are more concerned about staying green and majority of the food packagings are providing eco-friendly packagings. Manufactures are providing more natural coloured and recycled papers in food packagings with lining to meet the increasing environmental concerns.
According to the study “Asia Packaging Lining Industry Situation and Prospects Research Report”, the packaging lining market in Asia is divided based on type of products such as paper, plastic, rubber and other. The market is categorized based on applications such as food, beverage, electronics, industrial use and many more. Packaging lining market in Asia is geographically spread across China, Japan, India, Korea, Saudi Arabia and other regions. The leading players in Asia’s packaging lining market are JMP Holdings, Arena Products, Linertech, Protective Lining Corp., LC Packaging, Plascon, DS Smith, Shenzhen Dongtai Sponge Products, Kadary, Ian Bicking, Green Light Packaging, Rongyeda, Nantong Xinyi Sponge, Jiaxing Packing and Shanghai Zhongfan.
Asia is witnessing urbanisation, huge investments in housing and construction, development of retail chains, developing healthcare and cosmetics sectors are driving packagings with lining in economies such as China, India, Brazil, and Russia. It was observed that there is an increase in living standards and personal disposable income that encourages the consumption of package food and various other ranges of products which subsequently adheres the growth in packaging lining. The major market trends that drive Asia’s packaging lining are smaller households, demand for easy or ready to eat foods, demand for unadulterated products, and smaller pack sizes. These trends will drive the growth in the packaging lining market in Asia over the next few years.

Fighting cocks in Pampanga not spared as agriculture chief orders them culled, too
Contents:
EVEN the fighting cocks were not spared as Agriculture Secretary Emmanuel Piñol said he ordered the culling of these fighting roosters and hens in six game farms in Pampanga where the first bird flu outbreak in the province was reported.
“All fowls will be culled,” Piñol told The Manila Times in a text interview on Monday.
The agriculture chief, however, did not give an exact figure on the number of chickens to be killed.
The Department of Agriculture (DA) declared the outbreak of avian influenza type A subtype H5 in the town of San Luis, Pampanga, the country’s first, and at the same time ordered the culling of 400,000 chickens to prevent the virus from spreading.
Piñol said no animal-to-human transmissions have been reported.
The agriculture chief also noted that six poultry farms in the province were affected and about 37,000 chicken layers have died because of the virus.
Initial samples from a farm in Pampanga that reported very high mortalities in poultry tested positive for an H5 strain at the Bureau of Animal Industry’s Animal Disease Diagnosis and Reference Laboratory.
The samples were found to be negative for other avian respiratory diseases that have similar symptoms such as infectious larynx bronchi disease, infectious bronchitis and the virulent Newcastle disease.
Officials admitted there could still be poultry mortalities in the area that had yet to be reported.
San Luis, about 60 kilometers (37 miles) north of Manila, is close to the Candaba swamps, a major way station and destination for migratory birds that move out of the Asian mainland during winter.
Piñol also admitted to authorities that it has not been determined where the virus came from.

Bulls trample Celtics as Irving sits with thigh injury

The Celtics miss Kyrie Irving and Marcus Morris due to injuries
Published 12:33 PM, December 12, 2017
CHICAGO, USA - The Chicago Bulls took full advantage of Kyrie Irving's absence to romp to a 108-85 blowout against the Boston Celtics on Monday, December 11 (Tuesday Manila time).
Nikola Mirotic scored 24 points while Bobby Portis added 23 as the Bulls (6-20) stunned the Eastern Conference-leading Celtics.
Boston's preparations had been jolted after star point guard Irving was ruled out with a thigh injury just before the game in Chicago.
With forward Marcus Morris also missing with a sore left knee, the Celtics were forced to field an under-strength team just 24 hours after facing Detroit on Sunday.
The Bulls exploited Boston's makeshift line-up to full effect, with Mirotic producing a dominant display which also included 8 rebounds.
David Nwaba had 13 points while Kris Dunn had 12 points for Chicago.
Al Horford led the Boston scoring with 15 points, one of 5 Celtics players in double figures.
Boston fell to 23-6 with the defeat but remain secure on top of the Eastern Conference table with Toronto (17-7) their nearest rivals.
Boston had led 29-28 after the first quarter but Chicago romped clear in the second, surging into a 56-42 lead at the half.
Chicago managed to keep Boston at arm's length through the third quarter, maintaining a 15-point cushion at 78-63 heading into the fourth.
Chicago kept up the pressure in the final quarter, outscoring Boston by eight points to close out a deserved win.

Senate approves bill giving civil rights violators ‘cure period’
Contents:
State lawmakers gave final approval Monday to legislation to give businesses time to fix violations of disability laws that opponents say they should already be obeying.
SB 1406 would require someone affected by a violation of the Arizonans with Disabilities Act to notify the business owner who would have at least 30 days to fix the problem before litigation could be filed.
But the period of compliance could be much longer, 90 days or more, depending on the extent of the problem and whether building permits are required.
Only if there is no action at that point could someone who has been harmed by a violation take the business to court.
Senate Minority Leader Katie Hobbs, D-Phoenix, questioned why businesses should be given time to not comply with a law she said amounts to illegal discrimination — in her way of looking at it, the same kind discrimination that keeps business owners from refusing to serve someone based on race.
“This bill is taking civil rights away from people,” she said.
Hobbs said a 30-day cure period doesn’t exist for any other group affected by civil rights laws.
“If somebody tried to walk into a restaurant who is black, and that restaurant said, ‘Oh, I’m sorry, we’re not serving blacks,’ then that is a lawsuit right there,” Hobbs said.
Sen. Lupe Contreras, D-Avondale, said backers of SB 1406 would understand the problems of a “cure period” if they looked at it through the eyes of those who are affected, people who go off to war and come back disabled.
“You think they wouldn’t want to be given a cure period of 30 days, too, to change what’s going on with them at that time?” he asked.
But Sen. Karen Fann, R-Prescott, said she sees the legislation through a different lens.
“This is actually doing what the law is intending to do,” she said, “Identify the problem and fix it.”
What’s happened so far, Fann said, is “unscrupulous attorneys” have targeted businesses for what may be minor violations, file suit, negotiate a settlement, and “line their own pockets at the expense of our disabled community.”
“I think that is just an abomination and certainly not Christian-like in any way whatsoever,” Fann said.
There is no dispute that thousands of businesses were hit with lawsuits, all filed by the same firm, with offers to drop the matter for a cash settlement.
“Nobody supports that,” said Hobbs.
But she said that’s all in the past because Attorney General Mark Brnovich succeeded in getting all the cases consolidated and dismissed as frivolous. Hobbs said that shows there is no need for the new restrictions on the rights of the disabled to sue when there are legitimate problems.
Sen. John Kavanagh, R-Fountain Hills, who worked on a version of the legislation, said he believes the measure, which now goes to the governor after the 18-11 vote, addresses many key concerns of the disability community — with the key exception of the waiting period.
“I don’t think you could ever get them on to the bill with a real cure period,” he said.

CORRECTED-Hedge fund wants to unify BHP's corporate structure, split off U.S. oil
Contents:
(Corrects headline and first paragraph to show proposal is to scrap dual-corporate structure, not dual-listing)
SYDNEY, April 10 Hedge fund manager Elliott Advisors said on Monday it had sent a letter to BHP Billiton directors outlining a plan to unlock value by scrapping the mining giant's dual- corporate structure, demerging its oil business and rejigging its capital return policy.
"The goal is to provide details of the BHP shareholder value unlock plan to all of BHP's shareholders so that BHP can engage openly with all parties on the plan to unlock shareholder value," Elliot said in a statement.
Elliott Advisors said it holds a "long economic interest" of about 4.1 percent of the issued shares in BHP Billiton plc.
It also said it holds rights with its affiliates to acquire up to 0.4 percent of the issued shares in BHP Billiton ltd.

Child booster car seat law change

Child Seat: Expert reveals all you need to know about the law changes
Get daily updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Thank you for subscribing! Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email
Ahead of new child booster seat laws being introduced on March 1, data has revealed the extent of the public's bafflement.
Freedom of Information data requested by motoring experts Confused.com reveals there were 4,646 incidents of UK drivers not adhering to child seatbelt laws in 2015.
A total of 19,358 of these offences were recorded between 2013 and 2015.
Worryingly, new research reveals two thirds (66%) of parents do not understand the current car booster seat regulations.
Furthermore, over half (56%) are unaware of new booster seat regulations coming into force this year, and of those who are aware 87% do not understand the changes.
As the current UK law stands, all children travelling in a vehicle must use the correct car seat for their height, age and weight until they are either 12 years old or 135cm tall – whichever comes first.
Children weighing as little as 15kg (2st 4lbs) are permitted to travel in backless booster seats – for reference, on average, a child of this weight is about the age of a three year-old toddler.
Under the new rules backless booster seats - also known as booster cushions - will only be approved for use for children taller than 125cm and weighing more than 22kg (3st 6.5lbs).
To make it even more complicated, backless booster seats bought before the law changes can still be used after the regulation change as it will only apply to new products appearing on the market.
Perplexed? Well you are not alone.
The research commissioned by Confused.com into parents’ knowledge and attitudes towards booster seats and seat belts reveals over a third (34%) of parents admit to occasionally not using a booster seat for their child.
Excuses from parents include not transferring the booster seat when switching to another car (33%), believing their child did not need one (26%) and believing it was not needed as they were just making a short trip (25%).
Even for parents who use a booster seat, the law can be contentious, as debates are raging on social media over what is considered to be safe.
Whereas nearly half (46%) believe booster seats with backs are safer, one in six (16%) believe backless booster seats offer the same level of protection.
Research also suggested a cynical, 30% of parents believe increased booster regulations are a result of lobbying by profit driven car seat manufacturers.
Confused.com’s motoring editor Amanda Stretton says: “The current regulations are understandably hard to understand and the new changes may make it even trickier for parents to keep their children safe.
"The fact that car seats bought before the law change will still be acceptable to use sends mixed messages.
"The Government needs to simplify the messaging around backless car seat use so there is no misunderstanding over what is and is not safe.
“Parents must also be aware of the potential cost consequences of having an accident with their child in the car.
"Nearly half (44%) do not replace their child’s car seat after a crash.
However, parents should always replace booster seats after an accident, even if there is no obvious damage, as they may become weakened and unable to provide the same level of protection should a second collision occur.
"Regulatory approved car seats can cost in the region of £80 to £350.
"If parents are caught travelling with their child in the car without the correct booster for their age, height and weight, they could face a £100 fine.
“For more information on the new booster requirements and how to comply with the law, visit Confused.com.”
Tanya Robinson, Child Safety Centre Manager at TRL, added: “There is a large amount of uncertainty among parents and carers about the latest changes to child restraint regulations. Whilst this latest change will affect the types of child restraint available in future, there is not going to be a ban on “boosters”.
"What it means is that new booster cushions approved and coming to market after the upcoming change to Regulation 44 will only be suitable for children over 22kg and 125cm height.
"However, TRL recommend, where possible, to use a high back booster seat.
“Regardless of the detail of the regulations, it is vital that parents ensure that their child is in the correct type of seat for their height and weight, as this will allow for maximum protection in the event of an accident.
"Parents faced with the growing range and style of seats should remember there is no race to move a child into the next type of seat because they get older.
"Ensure that the car seat you choose is appropriate for your child’s weight, height and age and that it fits well in your vehicle.”

ETFs shattered their growth records in 2017
Contents:
Exchange-traded funds have been in the investing mainstream for years.
In 2017, they became the default.
ETFs saw record growth during the year, with both institutions and retail investors piling into the investment vehicle. ETFs hold baskets of securities like mutual funds but trade intraday like stocks. Among other attributes, advocates tout the transparency of the structure, as well as the greater tax efficiency, and in 2017 investors seemed more willing than ever to listen. There are now ETFs tracking essentially every sector, region and asset class, and basically every category of fund saw growth in the year.
According to data from Credit Suisse, inflows for exchange-traded products topped $424 billion in 2017 through November. (ETPs include both ETFs and the much smaller category of exchange-traded notes.) Not only does that shatter old records, but it is a stark demonstration of how investors are favoring ETFs over other investment vehicles. Mutual funds, for example, only saw $91 billion in inflows over that same period.
According to data from research firm ETFGI, there is $4.429 trillion in global ETF assets (ETFGI’s data is through October), compared with $3.396 trillion at the end of 2016 — meaning the universe has grown by more than a trillion dollars in less than a year. Over 2016, in comparison, ETF assets grew by a relatively paltry $522 billion, meaning adoption was twice as aggressive this past year.
U.S.-listed equity funds have seen $308.5 billion in year-to-date inflows, according to FactSet, which is not only a record for stock ETFs but is larger than the entire ETF industry has ever seen in a year. Fixed-income products had $120.5 billion in inflows, a record for the industry.
“ETFs have become the optimal choice for portfolio allocation, and this trend is definitely going to continue,” said Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research at State Street Global Advisors. SSGA is one of the three major ETF sponsors, along with Vanguard and BlackRock’s iShares, which together control about 70% of the market.
“There’s been broader adoption in all walks of life. Retail investors have gotten more accustomed to using these vehicles, and the industry has done a good job of breaking down the myths about liquidity, which has added to their being used more and more.”

The growth reflects the unique position ETFs hold in the investment universe. First, there is the ongoing shift toward passive products, which has been gaining steam for a decade but seemed to hit a tipping point over the past couple of years. There’s been a steady drumbeat of data showing that simply buying the market — as opposed to trying to do better than it through individual security selection — almost always leads to better returns over the long term, and ETFs are dominated by passive products.
The most popular fund of the year in terms of inflows, the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF IVV, +0.34% , is one of the most vanilla funds on the market, offering exposure to the primary U.S. equity-market benchmark. It amassed some $30.8 billion in inflows, according to FactSet.

ETFs have also benefitted from the move to low-fee products. Of the top 10 equity ETFs of 2017, measured by their inflows, the most expensive (the iShares MSCI EAFE ETF EFA, +0.26% had an expense ratio of 0.32%, or $32 for every $10,000 invested. For fixed-income products, the most expensive — the iShares J.P. Morgan USD Emerging Markets Bond ETF EMB, -0.05% —charged 0.39%. Other widely adopted funds charge less than 0.05% of assets, which make them wildly cheaper than actively managed products, which charge more than 0.8% on average, according to Morningstar Direct data.
2017 has been a year of high-profile fee cuts and new entrants undercutting their rivals by launching funds with lower expense ratios. In many categories, fees have fallen so much that institutional investors instead look to factors like liquidity and trading spreads in making their investment decisions, and in November Vanguard launched a fund with an industry-low fee, and urged investors to “consider elements beyond the expense ratio.”
The popularity of the ETF structure has meant hundreds of new funds getting launched over the course of the year. Per ETFGI data, there are nearly 5,400 ETFs traded globally, up from about 4,800 at the end of 2016. This growth has come alongside a rising number of fund closures, as few new products are able to amass the assets that are seen as necessary for them to be profitable.

Finally, and not insignificantly, ETFs have benefitted from the ongoing bull market across most major assets. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.32% is up 18.8% over the course of the year, hitting multiple records, while global stocks haven’t had a negative month since October 2016. Major bond categories are higher as well, and ETFs offer easy access to all those parts of the market.

Ivanka Tweets About Honoring Libraries After Dad Cuts Library Agency
Contents:
“This #NationalLibraryWeek, we honor our libraries and librarians for opening our eyes to the world of knowledge, learning and reading!” read the hypocritical tweet.
It seems Ivanka Trump is not well-informed about her father’s executive orders.
Either that or she just doesn’t care if she seems like a hypocrite.
Shortly after Ivanka tweeted out a post on equal pay for women on April 4th — a week after President Donald Trump overturned former President Obama’s “Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces” order — the first daughter posted a message to honor libraries and librarians.
This #NationalLibraryWeek, we honor our libraries and librarians for opening our eyes to the world of knowledge, learning and reading! — Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) April 14, 2017
However, it just so happens that her father last month decided to cut funding for the Institute of Museum and Library Services.
In March, Trump released his proposed budget plan for 2018, which would eliminate four independent cultural agencies, including the $230 million budget for the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS). The huge cut would be a devastating blow to state and local libraries and museums all over the country so it is quite ironic that Ivanka would tweet about “honoring” libraries just a month later.
Predictably, many of the libraries and librarians, not to mention library aficionados, were not amused by her tweet.

@IvankaTrump Thanks for honoring us, but we're in serious trouble if your dad has his way. Kind words won't pay the bills. #saveimls — Emily Clasper (@eclasper) April 14, 2017

@IvankaTrump Then stop defunding them so you don't look like a hypocrite. — YasmineGalenorn (@YasmineGalenorn) April 14, 2017
@IvankaTrump Then why are you cutting funding to libraries? — Art Blister (@blisteringart) April 14, 2017
Dear @IvankaTrump, thanks for the shout-out for #nationallibraryweek. Except tweets will not fund Libraries, your father keeping #IMLS will. — Stefanie Maclin-Hurd (@srmaclin) April 14, 2017
@IvankaTrump One great way to honor libraries is to NOT eliminate their federal funding! #saveIMLS — popi (@popijones) April 14, 2017
But this is hardly the first time Ivanka has displayed her hypocrisy. The first daughter has previously said she wanted to be champion of climate change, yet her father put a climate change denier at the head of the Environmental Protection Agency. In April, Ivanka met with the president of Planned Parenthood, Cecil Richards, but that did not prevent her father from signing a major anti-abortion bill that provides block grants to states.
Ivanka is now one of Trump’s top aides, which means she has considerable influence on her father’s decisions (if, for argument’s sake, she didn’t before). Eric Trump did say that the president’s bombing of Syria was a family decision in which Ivanka was heavily involved, after all. So, it must be easy for the first daughter to convince her dad not to cut down on the IMLS budget — if she wanted to, that is.

Captain’s Log: Food Chain Massed at West End of Santa Cruz Island
Contents:
My charter boat, WaveWalker, ran easily across the Santa Barbara Channel on flat, glassy seas, enjoying sightings of whales and common dolphins along our course.
We approached the tall bluff west end of Santa Cruz Island and began rounding Frazer Point, where the water seems nervous because currents and seas run in opposite directions and the reef zones channel flows and create eddies that can force a huge wave to climb unexpectedly out of the water.
We call them “rogue waves,” and this area is where they are spawned with some frequency.
This wary skipper is at my most vigilant when traversing this area we call the “Potato Patch.”
On this day we rounded Frazer Point without incident and came into view of the wide expanse of Christy’s Cove. The wild scene caused me to whistle softly in pleasant surprise. It seemed the entire food chain was crammed into Christy’s Cove. Several species of porpoise, including Risso, foraged throughout the area alongside small whales, sea lions, seals and enough seabirds to make one think Alfred Hitchcock might have been right about the birds.
As I cruised in among the melee, my sonar screen showed the reason. It lit up with thick squid signals. It was a major squid spawn. I saw six light boats lined up at anchor, and the last of the squid seiners was just leaving. It had been a busy night for the squid fleet. Interestingly, not a single fishing boat was in sight and we had the place to ourselves to target white seabass and halibut. Later, we moved in tight to the boiler rocks to catch and release big fiesty calico bass.
Such scenes are not all that rare. We have managed our resources to healthy stocks, and we are enjoying the thriving ocean full of life. Do not be influenced by people who seek grant money or donations and need to claim that the sky is falling and the seas are dead and we need to create no-take zones. Those are business people with their own interests in mind.
Our professional fisheries managers have carefully and painstakingly managed our fisheries back to health with good tried-and-true management practices, not by creating Marine Protected Areas, which cause socioeconomic damage and skew public perception about the abundance of life in the sea.

UPDATE 1-ConocoPhillips sells San Juan basin assets for $3 bln
Contents:
(Adds details, background)
April 13 ConocoPhillips, the largest U.S.
independent oil producer, said on Thursday it would sell natural gas-heavy assets in San Juan basin to privately held Hilcorp Energy Co for about $3 billion.
ConocoPhillips has been selling assets to reduce its exposure to profit-sapping natural gas assets and shore up its balance sheet.
The assets, which span New Mexico and Southwestern Colorado, produced 124,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, about 80 percent of which was natural gas, ConocoPhillips said.
Conoco said last month it would sell oil sands and western Canadian natural gas assets to Cenovus Energy Inc for $13.3 billion.
Conoco will receive $2.7 billion in cash from the San Juan basin asset sale, which is expected to close in the third quarter.
The deal also includes a contingent payment of up to $300 million.
Conoco, which said the assets being sold had a book value of about $5.9 billion at 2016-end, expects to record an impairment charge in the second quarter.
Houston-based Hilcorp has a partnership with private equity firm Carlyle Group LP to acquire and develop North American oil and gas properties. (Reporting by Ahmed Farhatha in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)

Escaping the crowds in Poland's concentration camps
Contents:
‘Is that sweat or is it raining outside?’ my mother enquired while looking up towards the stunning 1200m² glass-roof atrium of the Sheraton Grand Kraków.
It was overcast this sub-zero December morning so she could not have seen droplets and, at 100-odd feet tall, it would have been especially difficult to make them out, even if possessing the binocular vision of an eagle or outstretched neck of a crane. ‘It’s sweat,’ I replied before gulping down a glass of arctic-cold water at the juice bar. ‘Did you do what you needed to’, she asked as I returned to the breakfast table wiping my forehead, ‘since you said you couldn’t pay sufficient respect yesterday?’ Not since Luxor, when driving from the airport to the city centre, did I see such a long convoy of coaches (then en route to Hurghada) as that which snaked around roundabouts before slithering into a theme park-like parking lot in Oświęcim, a town better known by its Germanized name: Auschwitz. The coaches – displaying an array of European registration plates as well as windows emblazoned in both Arabic and Hebrew script – disgorged people at such an alarming yet life-affirming rate that numbers resembled those outside football stadia, with queues at turnstiles and in terms also of noise generated. The sight of so many sightseers at Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum (ABSM) is to be expected (since the concentration and extermination camps, arguably the most infamous places on the planet, received 2,100,000 visitors in 2017); ear-splitting, selfie-snapping crowds less so. Visitors taking selfies in front of the Arbeit Macht Frei sign at Auschwitz-I and, approximately 1.5 miles away, behind the iconic watchtower on railway tracks at Auschwitz-II has caused a stir recently, leading a documentary-filmmaker to position cameras around former Nazi death camps in order to better comprehend “dark” tourism. One of those camps filmed was Dachau, which limits the size of a tour group (30-35), the number of groups allowed to enter daily (15) as well as those starting at the same time (3). These measures ensure, says Dr. Sarah Hodgkinson, ‘that [the site] is not generally crowded as you wander around.’ Despite similar restrictions being in place at ABSM, hordes hinder the opportunity to absorb content and reflect on the c.1.1 million who perished in these death factories. (It is not before time that Anne Frank House, which received 1.3 million through its doors in Amsterdam in 2017, took steps to alleviate the snake-like queues which have become features both inside and outside by granting only pre-purchased ticketholders access for large segments of the day.) Unlike Michael Palin, who observed at length and in silence one of the gas chambers and two tonnes of human hair during his visit, I – like other non-BBC travel presenters – was exiting an exhibition room within a barracks near-enough as soon as entering it for another party of people was pouring in behind. And it was one of these party members who, while waiting in a corridor lined with prisoner photographs, mockingly referred to one as The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas. It was for this, among other reasons, that the next day I set off from the Sheraton (the overpriced surroundings Palin similarly inhabited), walking the five-odd mile round-trip – via the deeply affecting Ghetto Heroes Square – to the Płaszów Camp in the Podgórze district prior to checking out. Steven Spielberg’s 1993 worthy Oscar-winning film Schindler’s List (about German industrialist Oskar Schindler who performed a humane act during a time of horrifying inhumanity) introduced Płaszów – known hitherto merely among survivors and scholars – to the masses and yet, a quarter of a century on, I had a solitary dog-walker for company in the sparsely wooded hills. For this I was thankful given the lower number of casualties and less sanitized surroundings enabled me to engage with the past without pressure. After placing a stone – as is Jewish custom – at a memorial, I walked back, fast, past the hectares of advertising hoarding which provides a backdrop to the slow-running Vistula before answering my mother’s question in the affirmative since only now had I respected those 10,000 (primarily Jewish souls) who died at the forced labour-turned-concentration camp. Future visitors might not be able to reflect at such length and in silence, what with the planned commemorative project at this semi-neglected site of Holocaust history (where there is currently a pervasive lack of signage, with only small placards containing rudimentary information dotting the landscape), yet to paraphrase Palin: ‘[T]he evidence of brutality [must be] kept in good condition [if] people [are to] never be like this again.’ Related posts: A Summer Experience at Blue Star Camps Looking after 14 adolescent American schoolkids doesn't sound much fun to me.
